# News Site

The brief was to build a news site about anything I wanted to. The site should contain a logo, navbar and name of the site, one big news and four smaller news. The design should change depending on what devices you use.

## The problem

First, this was the first time in life for me to build a site so the problems where many. 
Tools and techniques I used where all videos from Technigo, google and asking questions in Slack. 
I solve problems with help from all that and just to try some code, change, try and change again.

If I had more time I would have done the last changings that I couldn't find a solution for. Sizes for a few images, grids that don't coooperate and a few other details. And I also wanna try to code a hamburgermenu wich I didn't had the time to. 
Also I will think about "mobile first" next time.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
